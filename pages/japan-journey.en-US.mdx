# 🇯🇵 Japan Journey

## Itinerary

### Day 1

During the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, I traveled to Japan with some friends. The plane landed at Kansai International Airport in Osaka. As we descended through the clouds, a vast sea came into view. Kansai International Airport is built amidst the ocean, offering a unique landing experience.

Initially, I was very worried that language barriers would make entering the country difficult, but the actual immigration process turned out to be smoother and simpler than I had imagined. The attractive immigration officer, coupled with the small gesture of licking lips, instantly maximized my positive impression of Japan. This was my first impression of the Japanese people.

With my friend's assistance, after fiddling for a few minutes in front of the ICOCA recharge machine, we finally succeeded in loading the fare onto the card. The recharge machine only accepts Japanese yen in cash.

Osaka's JR lines are very well-developed but also extremely complex. Coupled with the language barrier, we almost gave up right at the airport. After much effort, we finally figured out the route to our Airbnb accommodation.

In Japan, JR line is divided into many different train services, each skipping a different number of stations based on their "priority level". The slowest, local train service, stops at every station, while the fastest, the Ltd. Express train, stops almost exclusively at major hub stations.

As the JR train arrived, we boarded with excitement that was hard to contain. We were lively, chatting and sharing observations, marveling at the cleanliness of Japanese houses' exteriors, their fondness for pointed rooftops, and the unique charm and ambiance of the streets. However, we soon noticed that the other passengers in the carriage were silent, each engrossed in reading or daydreaming, so we quieted down as well. The carriage was more silent than one would expect for a Friday afternoon.

In the midst of silence, we quickly arrived at our Airbnb. After dropping off our luggage, we headed to a local ramen shop. The ramen shop was small and only had a menu in Japanese, with the owner speaking only Japanese. With the help of Google Translate and a friend who knew a bit of Japanese, we finally managed to order six bowls of ramen.

As expected, the taste was completely different from the ramen available in China. The soup was rich, lingering, and savory, with the noodles being slightly firm. The chashu pork was very aromatic, and the scallions were fragrant, yet it wasn't as spicy as the versions found in China. It might not be the most palatable for Chinese tastes, but it was indeed a different kind of deliciousness.

Beyond the taste of the ramen, Japan is indeed a country with unique characteristics in every aspect, from television programs to the atmosphere, and its people, all of which are quite different from China.


### Day 2

On the second day, we embarked on an intensive exploration of Osaka, visiting Osaka Castle, then moving on to Shinsaibashi, taking photos and walking around along the way.

In the morning at Osaka Castle, I deeply felt the limitations of the 55mm lens in certain situations. It was neither wide enough to capture expansive scenes nor long enough for detailed shots. Moreover, being unfamiliar with this focal length made it challenging to take good landscape photos.

For portraits, the appropriate focal length combined with a systematic composition made it easier to manage, especially with the support of good hardware.

Continuing on this way, walking and snapping photos, we found that Osaka Castle was quite crowded with tourists, and Mandarin could often be heard as we walked along.

On the way, we encountered a couple taking wedding photos. The bride was dressed in a full set of kimono, which was quite luxurious. It was probably my first time seeing someone in a kimono in person in Japan. Out of courtesy, I refrained from sneakily taking pictures, so the photo mentioned comes from one of the friends accompanying me.

In front of Osaka Castle, we encountered a Shiba Inu, which, according to the sign, is considered a sacred dog of the castle. It was adorable and well-behaved. Its owner placed a piece of cheese on its paw, and the dog resisted eating it until given a command, then enjoyed the treat. This Shiba Inu bore a slight resemblance to the flying disk, making it a true encounter with a "Japanese native dog".

After leaving Osaka Castle, we arrived at Shinsaibashi. In the middle of the day, Shinsaibashi, though lacking the dazzling neon lights of the night, was bustling and full of life, with a sea of people everywhere. The streets were crowded, and compared to the area around our Airbnb in Noda, it felt as if all of Japan was squeezed onto this street.

For lunch at Shinsaibashi, we ate at Ichiran Ramen. It felt significantly more catered to Chinese tastes compared to the small ramen shop we first visited upon arriving in Japan: the flavors were more palatable, there was a Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese guide, and we could hear Mandarin spoken occasionally between the tables. <br /><br />

Ichiran Ramen offers a rich array of customizable options: the firmness of the noodles, the density of the soup, the thickness of the oil layer on the surface, and the level of saltiness, among others, with the option to add extra side dishes. Besides ramen, the matcha tofu on the right is highly recommended. It's fantastic and delicious, with the refreshing aroma of matcha and the smooth texture of tofu. The sweet taste tantalizes the taste buds, wow.

Apart from eating, Shinsaibashi is an undeniable shopping paradise. After finishing our ramen, girls went to buy cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, while boys browsed other small shops.<br /><br />

Japan truly is a paradise for enthusiasts of geek culture.There are entire floors dedicated to Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card shops, where rare cards are sold for tens of thousands of yen. There are many Surugaya like buildings: first floor is filled with video game and various toys; second floor is filled with a wide range of comics and anime DVDs; third floor for for TV dramas; top floor for 18+ content 

![1st.jpg](/japan-journey/1st.jpg)图：hammmmm....

18r 点里多是中年的大叔，大家相安无事，互不打扰地翻找着喜欢的光碟，这静谧的氛围，竟给我一种正在图书馆中翻找书籍感觉。

逛了一天，累的不行，晚上回到野田后，在民宿附近找了一加居酒屋，尝了尝日本地道的梅子酒，点了一份长得很像牛肉的金枪鱼刺身。

![bbq.jpg](/japan-journey/bbq.jpg)图：牛肉刺身....

In the 18+ shops, most of the customers are middle-aged men. Everyone coexists peacefully, quietly browsing through their preferred DVDs without disturbing each other. This serene atmosphere surprisingly gave me the feeling of searching for books in a library.

### Day 3

On the third day, our destination was Universal Studios Japan (USJ). We almost went through all the attractions — Harry Potter, The Flying Dinosaur, the rollback, Jaws, Minions, EVA battling Godzilla, and Spider-Man. The thrill rides were amazing, in two words: fun and exciting. The scenario simulation attractions were also very immersive and spectacular, with the Jaws performer putting on an enthusiastic show. Although we didn't understand much of what was said, the overflowing acting skills provided us with a great experience.

USJ is filled with many beautiful JK (Japanese high school girl) enthusiasts. While waiting in line with nothing much to do, casually glancing around often revealed several delicate and pretty faces.<br /><br />

The overall impression is that Japanese girls are very refined and beautiful, but boys still have room for improvement overall.

Japanese people tend to be introverted, strictly adhering to procedures and order. They neither wish to trouble others nor be troubled themselves, which can come across as somewhat indifferent, rarely expressing emotions easily. They are accustomed to maintaining silence in public places, so much so that you might not even notice a line forming behind you in a supermarket or while recharging a Suica card. Our Airbnb host cautioned us to keep quiet after 7 PM, mentioning incidents where guests from China were reported to the police and asked to leave due to noise disturbances at night.

Japanese people are polite and humble, but this can also make them seem distant or even elusive. However, I believe they also have a passion in their hearts; it's just expressed differently—like the uninhibited noise in an izakaya, which may be their way of releasing the stress of the day.

My favorite photo of the day captures a Japanese couple sharing a passionate kiss in front of the globe at USJ. The moment I pressed the shutter, I felt a genuine warmth. It was this kind of straightforward, overflowing happiness that really touched me. I wish them all the best.

### Day 4

On the fourth day, we went to Nara, with the theme being "Memoirs of Being Bumped by Deer." It's unclear where Nara's deer learned to bow, but they nod in gratitude while eating food from the hands of tourists. There's a give and take, wonderfully so.

I particularly want to talk about the Airbnb we stayed in today, which was truly in the traditional Japanese style, even including two samurai swords.<br /><br />

### Day 5

On the fifth day, our destination was Kiyomizu-dera, with the theme being kimonos. Coming to Japan, trying on kimonos is a popular choice for many couples, and today, we also joined friends for a photoshoot in them.

Along the way, we saw many girls dressed in kimonos, and the Sony α7R III in my hands reassured me that we had indeed come to the right place.

In the afternoon, we continued to visit several temples, and as the number of tourists increased, finding a spot without people for a clear shot became increasingly difficult.<br /><br />

In the evening, we arrived in Kyoto and bought some gifts. We packed up and prepared ourselves emotionally for the return trip home.

### Day 6

Home! And we're already planning our next trip for the coming year, with Tokyo as our next destination. lol


## Thoughts

### Sony A7R3 + 55 1.8 ZA len

During this trip to Japan, I exclusively used the 55 1.8 ZA lens for photography, transitioning from unfamiliarity to familiarity with the 55mm focal length. The 55mm lens is somewhat long, making it less ideal for capturing buildings, landscapes, and scenes requiring a grand expression; it's also not long enough, which makes it less suitable for close-ups or scenes requiring compression of depth. As the old masters would say, it's like "plain boiled water"—a standard lens without any distinctive features.

Since it's not possible to excel through perspective with this focal length, the focus shifted to capturing subjects or stories, resulting in a selection of photos that triumph through human stories.

However, the moderate length of 55mm also has its advantages for street photography: it doesn't require getting too close to the subject, which is suitable for those who are shy; it's also not too far from models, facilitating easy communication. Of course, its biggest advantage is its portability—the size and weight of the 55 1.8 ZA make it easy to carry all day, so I ended up not using the 24-105G lens I had prepared for the trip due to its weight, even though a zoom lens is often more versatile.

As for the A7R III, all I can say is Sony's excellence is apparent, with the only drawback being its price. The camera offers ultra-high resolution, rapid autofocus, high dynamic range, a robust viewfinder and screen, dual card slots, quick startup, and high ISO performance due to its full-frame sensor. Paired with a large aperture prime lens, it's easy to capture beautifully blurred background images.

However, relying too heavily on superior hardware can lead to a dependency on depth of field control to convey a theme, neglecting composition and spacing, which are crucial elements in mobile photography.

### Atmosphere

![Street.jpg](/japan-journey/Street.jpg)PIC: Street

The social atmosphere in Japan is distinct from that in China. There's a clear hierarchy in relationships, especially in the workplace where subordinates are expected to use honorific language when addressing superiors. The photo taken on the first night after arriving in Noda captures a scene during a street photography session, illustrating this societal aspect.

![Market.jpg](/japan-journey/Market.jpg)PIC：Supermarket

The Japanese people are indeed very reserved and polite. One evening, while shopping for instant curry at a supermarket, my friend and I were trying to figure out whether a particular flavor was spicy or not, as we couldn't understand the text. We accidentally blocked the aisle between shelves, hindering a lady from passing through. She stood quietly beside us, waiting until we noticed her presence. If this were in China, someone might have simply said "excuse me" or squeezed past us.

On another occasion, we were recharging our transportation cards at a JR station machine. Due to our lack of understanding of Japanese, it took us a while to successfully recharge the cards. When we finally finished and stepped away, we were surprised to find a long line had formed behind us, with no fewer than seven people waiting quietly in line. It was quite a shock to realize just how patient they had been.

## Postscript

Since I began writing this article, more than half a year has passed, a delay largely due to my procrastination. After returning from Japan, I spent over three months just editing photos. As the saying goes, shooting in the moment is fun, but selecting the best shots later can be tearfully overwhelming. As the New Year approached, I thought it wouldn't be right to drag something that should have been completed in the 2010s into the 2020s, so I made it a point to finish this piece before New Year's Eve.
